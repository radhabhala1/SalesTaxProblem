Question:
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical
products which are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported
goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.
When I purchase items I receive a receipt that lists the name of all the items and their price
(including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes
paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p
contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.
